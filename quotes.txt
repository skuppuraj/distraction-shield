Discipline is doing what needs to be done, even when you don't feel like it.
Don’t trade what you want most for what you want now.
Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
Consistency is more important than intensity.
Small steps every day lead to big results.
Focus on your future self, not your current mood.
Just 5 more minutes of focus — then take a break.
If you quit now, you'll be back at square one.
Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out.
Your time is your most valuable asset.
